Reflection: 

Project One on Infrastructure in Wellington was extremely difficult. It was the first time I have ever had to code something and I found it extremely challenging. I had never used the programme sublime before however, once I found my way around how to use the programme I found it much easier to use. I learnt that you colours have a different name than usual such as, pearl for white. Furthermore, the style of the website had a different CSS. To improve the style of my website about the Infrastructure of Wellington I believe it would look better if the images were in the middle underneath the text. Furthermore, I would prefer if the navigation bar at the top went right along the page. 

Considering this is my first website I have programmed I am proud of my efforts. Although it is not the best, I believe it is great for a first timer. 

Github was an extremely hard programme to navigate. I struggled when trying to upload and publish my website. Terminal was unable to find my document thus, it was a struggle to upload.
