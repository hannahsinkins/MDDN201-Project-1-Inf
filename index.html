			<h1>Power Lines</h1>
			<p> Power lines are a structure used in electric power transmission and distibution to transmit electrical energy across large distances. They produce electric and magnetic fields. Power lines are the lowest-cost method of transmission for large quantities of electric power. They transfer electricity to power the tools and machines used to connect to various networkds. Providing phone lines, connection to the internet, power lines connect the modern world. </p>

				<h1>Attenas</h1>
				<p>Attenas have two basic functions. The receiver side, converts electromagnetic energy into voltage, which gets processed and converted to digital data. The transmitter side, transforms voltage into electromagnetic energy that radiates into the air. Attenas enable various wireless networking. Attenas are installed high to ensure their beams spread. They can provide access to network television, mobiles and internet. They ensure the widest possible georgraphical coverage, and to maintain a sufficient density of transmitting and receiving antennas to handle all the traffic at a given point. </p>
